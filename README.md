# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Competition
The Coursera-Machine-Learning-Competition required participants to predict which students will resubscribe to Coursera based on dataset provided. The task required participants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict which students are likely to resubscribe.

The train dataset for the competion contained 413,956 and 35 features whiles the testset contained 217,992 records. Despite the overly large size of the dataset and my computer running on a CPU, i was able to get an accuracy of 76% scoring in the top 5%. The competion lasted for only 12 hours. I used Histogram-beased gradient boosting for this competion which is a variation of the Gradient Boosting algorithm that uses histogram-based algorithms to speed up the computation of decision trees. In traditional Gradient Boosting algorithms, decision trees are constructed by splitting the data into two subsets based on a threshold value. However, this method can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets. In Histogram-based Gradient Boosting, the algorithm uses a histogram-based approach to build decision trees more efficiently. 
The reason i used Histogram Based Gradient Boosting is because of the deadline factor and the running on a CPU.
